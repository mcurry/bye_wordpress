/* Description */
A CakePHP shell for migrationg a Wordpress (tested on v2.8.6) database to Croogo.

/* Warning */
I'm done with this code.  I migrated my two sites, so I have no reason to keep it up.

/* Gotchas */
* Make sure the two databases have the same character encoding.
* Uploaded files aren't moved - just the DB record.  Make sure to manually copy /wp-content/uploads to /app/webroot/uploads
* If you use Tags and Catagories in WordPress everything will become a Catagory in Croogo.  I'm to lazy to fix and I never used WordPress tags so it didn't matter to me.
* Draft posts aren't moved.

/* Instructions */
 1. Download the and install croogo (http://www.croogo.org).
 2. Download the plugin to /app/plugins/bye_wordpress
 3. Run it cake/console/cake bye_wordpress
